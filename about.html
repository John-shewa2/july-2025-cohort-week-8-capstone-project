Our Story: The Vision Behind Ethio Thrift

Ethio Thrift is more than just a store; it's a testament to the power of vision, community, and sustainable fashion, born from the heart and passion of its founder, Selam.

Early Seeds of Inspiration (Early 2010s)
Selam's journey began not in a bustling marketplace, but in quiet reflection on the dual challenges of textile waste and the economic realities faced by many in her beloved Ethiopia. Growing up, she witnessed firsthand the vibrancy of Ethiopian culture and the ingenuity of its people, but also recognized the need for accessible, quality clothing solutions that didn't compromise on style or dignity. She harbored a dream of creating a business that served both people and the planet.

A Passion Takes Shape (Mid-2010s)
After completing her studies, Selam immersed herself in the world of fashion and business, gaining invaluable experience in retail management and supply chain logistics. However, her true calling remained rooted in her initial inspiration. She spent countless hours researching sustainable practices, understanding the lifecycle of clothing, and envisioning a modern thrift concept that could thrive in an Ethiopian context. It was during this period that the core philosophy of Ethio Thrift – "Fashion with a Story" – began to crystalize.

The Leap of Faith: Founding Ethio Thrift (2018)
With unwavering determination, Selam took the bold step of founding Ethio Thrift in 2018. Starting from a modest space, she meticulously curated a collection of pre-loved clothing and shoes, focusing on quality, style, and affordability. Her initial days were a whirlwind of hands-on work, from sourcing and cleaning to merchandising and connecting with her first customers. Selam believed that second-hand didn't mean second-best, and she poured her heart into transforming perceptions of thrift shopping.

Building Community and Impact (2019 - Present)
Since its inception, Ethio Thrift under Selam's leadership has grown into a vibrant hub. It quickly became known not just for its unique finds, but for its welcoming atmosphere and commitment to giving back. Selam actively champions local initiatives, partnering with community programs to provide clothing to those in need and offering employment opportunities. She has fostered a team that shares her passion for sustainability and customer service, making every visit to Ethio Thrift a warm and engaging experience.

Today, Selam continues to lead Ethio Thrift with the same pioneering spirit, constantly seeking new ways to expand its impact, offering fashionable and affordable choices while advocating for a more sustainable future for fashion in Ethiopia and beyond. Her vision continues to inspire, proving that every piece of clothing truly does have a story, and together, we can write a new chapter for sustainable style.
